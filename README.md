# UpFile Discord Bot
This repository contains the source code for the UpFile Discord bot, a tool designed to integrate UpFile functionalities within your Discord server.

## âœ¨ Planned Features (Next Updates):
 * Upload Files to UpFile: Allow users to upload files directly to UpFile through Discord commands. This will streamline the sharing process and keep everything centralized.
 * UpFile Link Validation:  Implement a system to check the validity of UpFile links shared in the server. This will prevent broken links and ensure users can access the intended files.
 * UpFile Information Retrieval:  Develop commands for users to query the bot for information about UpFile's features, storage limits, security practices, or other relevant details.
 * Additional Features (Consider):
   * Integrate with UpFile's user accounts to personalize the experience (requires secure authorization).
   * Implement file size limitations for uploads initiated through Discord.
   * Add notification features for upload completion or errors.
